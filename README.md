Since the original files, text files after data cleaning and files containing the tokenized text are much larger than Github’s capacity of 25 MB, all of these files can be accessed in the Google Drive using LionMail. 

## Introduction
Censorship, the suppression of speech, public communication and other information, has significant implications on individuals’ freedom to speech in a country. As the Internet rapidly develops in the 21st century, social media becomes the major platform for individuals to share information and speak up. In China, one of the most influential social media platforms that boasts over 500 million registered users as of 2021 is called Sina Weibo. When the platform was first launched in 2009, the Chinese government praised it for enabling people to raise suggestions for the government on the platform. However, the censorship mechanism on Weibo became stronger over the past decade and created enormous fear for people to speak freely on the platform. 
This research intends to investigate how the censorship device operates on Weibo by looking at a database called Weiboscope that collects 111 censored posts in 2012 from Weibo. 
The major research question of this study is: what are the important keywords that trigger the censorship mechanism on Weibo?

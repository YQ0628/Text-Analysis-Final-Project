## Abstract
Censorship, the suppression of speech, public communication and other information, has significant implications on individualsâ€™ freedom to speech in a country. As the Internet rapidly develops in the 21st century, social media becomes the major platform for individuals to share information and speak up. In China, one of the most influential social media platforms that boasts over 500 million registered users as of 2021 is called Sina Weibo. When the platform was first launched in 2009, the Chinese government praised it for enabling people to raise suggestions for the government on the platform. However, the censorship mechanism on Weibo became stronger over the past decade and created enormous fear for people to speak freely on the platform. 
This research investigates how the censorship device operates on Weibo by looking at a database called Weiboscope that collects 111 million censored posts in 2012 from Weibo. In particular, it randomly selected 2-month period data to conduct the analysis using TF-IDF test. 


## Research Question
The major research question of this study is: what are the important keywords that trigger the censorship mechanism on Weibo?

## Results
According to the tf-idf test results, the expected keywords that reflect a relationship with international and governmental affairs appear in the list of the most mentioned words in the dataset. However, the results only returns general terms that are not able to reflect the specific political issues that are targeted by the censorship mechanism.

## Conclusion
To summarize, Weibo posts that contain political discussion are highly likely to be targeted by the internet censorship machine. However, further investigation is needed to explore the the most sensitive words that are related to specific political issues.
